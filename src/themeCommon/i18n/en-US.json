Despite slow economic growth, high inflation expectations make it difficult for the ECB to pause the rate hike. More rate increases may occur in July to combat inflation. The new rates will be effective from June 21st. The ECB aims to bring down inflation to 2% in the medium term. In May, the Eurozone's overall inflation rate was 6.1%, and the core inflation rate was higher than expected. The ECB revised its inflation expectations for 2023, while the Federal Reserve announced a pause in rate hikes. Investors should watch the Eurozone CPI YoY data on June 30th to assess future rate changes.",
