                    <p class='information'>
                        The Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates from record-low levels since last year in order to fight inflation. Higher interest rate cause investors to have less appetite for risk, because the cost of borrowing money becomes more expansive. This trend has negatively impacted to technology startups, which are the primary clients of Silicon Valley Bank. And making their investors more risk-averse.

                        Due to an impact of higher interest rates in the market for initial public offerings and the increased cost of private fundraising, some SVB’s clients began withdrawing money to meet their liquidity needs. As a result, the bank was being forced to seek ways to meet its customers’ withdrawal requests.

                        On Friday (10 March 2023) SVB worked frantically to secure alternative funding, even considering the sale of the company. However, later of the day, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) declared that SVB was closed and placed it under receivership. The FDIC stated that they would attempt to sell SVB’s assets and that uninsured depositors may receive future dividend.

                        While SVB’s actions in the past week, including a failed capital raise and pressure from venture capitalists, contributed to its collapse, the bank’s demise was set in motion months prior.

                    <p class='information'>
                        After the announcement, the FDIC stated that SVB’s branch offices would reopen on Monday for insured depositors to withdraw their money. The FDIC provides coverage of up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category. And some of them may be insured for more than $250,000 if they had more than one type of deposit account, since each account is covered separately.

                    1. Small Banks Are Hit
                </p>
                <p>After the failure of SVB and Signature bank, the bank shares in the US, Asia and Europe had been affected. It is because investors worried about the general state of the banking sector.</p>
                <p style='padding: 15px 0'>
                    Smaller US lenders were hit hard and some failed-on Tuesday, despite having reassured customers that they had enough cash to protect themselves from shocks. The initial sell-off continued even though they had taken steps to ensure their financial stability.
                </p>
                <p>Investors are concerned that the recent failures of two banks may indicate potential issues at other financial institutions. However, given that most banks diversify their investments across various sectors and maintain sufficient cash reserves, it is generally assumed that the risk to the broader banking industry is relatively low.</p>
                <p style='padding: 15px 0'>
                    The recent bank failures have brought to light the fact that some banks may be risker that they appear, as they ay have incurred losses on their investments in government bonds due to rising interest rates, causing their value to decline. This is a concern that investors have become increasingly aware of in the past few days and is one of the reasons why banks shares have experienced a decline.

                </p>
                <p>The tech industry is reeling from the sudden collapse of SVB financial group, a top Silicon Valley lender. Tech startups are struggling to make payroll this month, and there are concerns that a wave of failures and layoffs could follow throughout the industry.</p>
                <p style='padding: 15px 0'>
                    Known for providing banking services to early stage startups and financing high-risk projects, SVB financial group has been a vital resource for the tech startup community. Unfortunately, the bank was closed by California’s banking regulators on Friday due to inadequate liquidity and insolvency, despite having approximately $209 billion in total assets and $175.4 billion in total deposits at the end of last year.
                </p>
                <p>On Friday, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assured account holders that they would have swift access to the insured portions of their deposits. However, the amount beyond that will depend on the sales of the bank assets, which is typically a lengthy process. This uncertainty has caused concern for startup founders who are unsure if they will be able to meet their payroll obligations.</p>
                <p style='padding: 15px 0'>
                    Nearly half of the tech and healthcare startups that went public in 2022 and were backed by venture capital were SVB customers, causing widespread worry about the potential fallout from the bank’s collapse. The tech sector has already experienced significant layoffs in recent months, and this event is expected to further impact the industry.

                <p style='padding: 0 0 55px'>
                    Although China’s stock market may experience an initiate decline due to a knee-jerk reaction to the shift in global financial market sentiment, it is expected to stabilize quickly as the probability of significant interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve diminishes. This will allow investors to shift their focus towards China’s economic recovery, potentially resulting in increased investment in the country.
