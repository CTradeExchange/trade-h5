                    Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users' personal information to others. Vitatoken shares users' personal information only as described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of Vitatoken that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. Third party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws. Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Vitatoken or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets. Protection of Vitatoken and others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Vitatoken, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
