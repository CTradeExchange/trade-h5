            <h4>Indicator Features</h4>
            <p>• The CCI indicator has excellent sensitivity. When the price trend changes slightly, the CCI indicator can always give a trading instruction signal at the first time</p>
            <p>• The CCI indicator has an early warning function. When the price enters a strong rising or falling market, the three curves in the CCI indicator will enter the ultra-low or ultra-high area in turn. The higher or lower the value, the greater the possibility of reversal</p>
            <p>• CCI indicators are highly compatible with other technical indicators</p>

            <h4>Usage of CCI</h4>
            <h5>Upside Breakout</h5>
            <p>When the K line breaks through the D line on the graph, commonly known as the golden cross, it is a buying signal. In addition, when the K line and the D line cross upwards below 20, the short-term buying signal at this time is more accurate; if the K value is below 50, cross the D value twice to form a higher golden cross "W" If there is no form, the stock price may have a considerable rise, and the market prospect is promising.</p>
            <h5>Downside Breakout</h5>
            <p>When the K value is getting smaller and smaller, and then falls below the D line from above, it is usually called a dead cross, and it is regarded as a sell signal. In addition, when the K line and the D line cross down at the 80 mark, the short-term sell signal at this time is more accurate. If the K value is above 50, crosses below the D line twice in the trend, and dies from the low "M" shape, the market prospect may have a considerable stock price drop.</p>
