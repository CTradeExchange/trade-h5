            <h4>What is KDJ</h4>
            <p>KDJ, also known as the stochastic indicator, was first used in the analysis of the futures market, pioneered by George Lane (George Lane), and is now widely used in the short-term trend analysis of the stock market. Stochastic indicator (KDJ) is calculated based on the highest price, lowest price and closing price, and the K value, D value and J value obtained form a point on the coordinates of the indicator, connecting countless such points , forming a complete KDJ indicator that can reflect the price fluctuation trend.</p>

            <h4>Indicator Features</h4>
            <p>• The KDJ indicator has excellent sensitivity. When the price trend changes slightly, the KDJ indicator can always give a trading instruction signal at the first time</p>
            <p>• The KDJ indicator has an early warning function. When the price enters a strong rising or falling market, the three curves in the KDJ indicator will enter the ultra-low or ultra-high area in turn. The higher or lower the value, the greater the possibility of reversal</p>
            <p>• KDJ indicators are highly compatible with other technical indicators</p>

            <h4>Usage of KDJ</h4>
            <h5>Golden Cross</h5>
            <p>When the K line breaks through the D line on the graph, commonly known as the golden cross, it is a buying signal. In addition, when the K line and the D line cross upwards below 20, the short-term buying signal at this time is more accurate; if the K value is below 50, cross the D value twice to form a higher golden cross "W" If there is no form, the stock price may have a considerable rise, and the market prospect is promising.</p>
            <h5>Death Cross</h5>
            <p>When the K value is getting smaller and smaller, and then falls below the D line from above, it is usually called a dead cross, and it is regarded as a sell signal. In addition, when the K line and the D line cross down at the 80 mark, the short-term sell signal at this time is more accurate. If the K value is above 50, crosses below the D line twice in the trend, and dies from the low "M" shape, the market prospect may have a considerable stock price drop.</p>
            <h5>Overbought</h5>
            <p>The value of KDJ ranges from 0 to 100 (the J value sometimes exceeds), the K value is above 80, the D value is above 70, and when the J value is greater than 90, it is overbought. Under normal circumstances, the stock price may fall. Investors should act cautiously, outsiders should not chase the rise, and insiders should sell in due course.</p>
            <h5>Oversold</h5>
            <p>The value of KDJ ranges from 0 to 100 (J value sometimes exceeds), K value below 20, D value below 30 is the oversold zone. Under normal circumstances, the stock price is likely to rise, and the possibility of a rebound increases. Insiders should not throw it out easily, and outsiders can find opportunities to enter the market.</p>
